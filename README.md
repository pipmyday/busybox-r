## Build

Check out the [R source](https://cran.r-project.org/sources.html) into a directory below this (i.e. `../R-3.2.3/`) . `./configure --with-x=no` and `make`.

Run `bash ./build.sh`. The build is meant for Ubuntu/Wily64 using glibc. The dynamic shared libraries are copied into `./shared-libs/` and the R binaries and support files got into `./r-install`. The docker image `pipmyday/r:latest` is built by default, you may want to change this.
